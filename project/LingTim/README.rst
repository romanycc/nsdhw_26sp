## Motivation
Since native Python is inherently slow for numerical computations, developers
rely heavily on NumPy for acceleration. While NumPy's backend is
traditionally built with C and Fortran, modern C++ has become the mainstream
standard for system software.
Therefore, this project aims to simulate the underlying logic of NumPy's
matrix operations using purely C++.

## Operations and Routines
I will implement the following core operations as C++ extensions for Python:

1.Test programs.
2. Define the C++ N-dimensional array.
3. Implement element-wise operations.
4. Implement broadcasting operations.
5. Implement reduction operations.
6. Implement tensor contraction.

**Optimization & Interface:**
* All operations will first be implemented in standard C++ (naive baseline)
to verify correctness. Subsequently, the **AVX instruction set** will be
explicitly utilized to vectorize and accelerate the computations.
* **Pybind11** will be used to wrap and compile these C++ functions into
`.pyd` dynamic libraries, making them directly callable within Python.

## Performance Goals
Instead of attempting to beat the highly optimized production-level NumPy,
the goal of this project is to benchmark and analyze the performance
differences between pure Python implementations, the naive C++ baseline,
and the AVX-optimized C++ versions.

## Schedule

* **Week 6-7(3/30~4/12):** Write test programs, define the C++ N-dimensional array data
structure, and handle strides and shapes.

* **Week 8(4/13~4/19):** Implement element-wise operations.

* **Week 9(4/20~4/26):** Implement broadcasting and reduction operations.

* **Week 10(4/27~5/3):** Implement tensor contraction.

* **Week 11(5/4~5/10):** Apply AVX2 instructions and cache-friendly loop tiling to tensor contraction.

* **Week 12(5/11~5/17):** Benchmark pure Python, naive C++, and optimized C++, and analyze memory and CPU bottlenecks.
